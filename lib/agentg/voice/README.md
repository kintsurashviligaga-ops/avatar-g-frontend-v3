# Agent G Voice (Phase 3 Skeleton)

Planned flow (not implemented in this PR):

1. WebRTC client stream enters backend gateway.
2. Gateway brokers real-time events with OpenAI Realtime model.
3. Generated text/audio tokens route through TTS/stream adapter.
4. Frontend receives low-latency partial updates for live conversation.

This folder is intentionally a placeholder for Phase 3 implementation.
